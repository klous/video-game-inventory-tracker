# Video Game Inventory Tracker

The purpose of this project is so that you can track the console games, consoles, and PC games that you own, whether ownership is physical or digital.

This project allowed me to plan out the database structure based on the goals of my project and create all the SQL queries to create the database structure. I then set out to implement relevant JDBC interfaces between the data object in Java and the data they needed to retrieve or create in the database. The REST end points were created in a controller to allow requests to be made to the application.

The endpoints allow you to view data in the database about platforms and their games. It also will allow you to update or add data to the base database or add games or video game systems that you own to your 'collection' and represent that in their digital or physical form. 

It has a REST API, [the endpoints](endpoints.md) are indicated in this document - that were created using Spring Boot. The data is stored in PostgreSQL.
